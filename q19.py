    String Rotation: Assume you have a method isSubstring which checks if one
    word is a substring of another. Given two strings, s1 and s2, write code
    to check if s2 is a rotation of s1 using only one call to isSubstring
    (e.g., "waterbottle" is a rotation of "erbottlewat").

    Hints: #34, #88, #104
