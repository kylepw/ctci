    ~~~~~~
    Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may
    assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the
    additional characters, and that you are given the "true" length of the
    string.

    EXAMPLE
    Input: "Mr John Smith    ", 13
    Output: "Mr%20John%20Smith"
    Hints: #53, #118
